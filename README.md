This discord bot keeps track of "Friend Points." Data is stored within a .db file using SQLITE. the bot runs on Node JS and uses discord.js to interact with discord. I work on the bot in my free time and add functionality as needed. A feture that is being implemented is "card" generation. To do this I use data the bot stores with canvas to generate images that get sent in response to commands.
